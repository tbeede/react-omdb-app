# OMDb Search

This project uses the [Open Movie Database API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to retrieve movie results and displays them in a grid.

You can play with it [here](https://tbeede.github.io/react-omdb-app/).

### To Run

Simply clone the repo and run

`$ npm install && yarn start`

##### Bugs

This is a work in progress. I've taken note of the bugs and enhancements and will get to them as I can!

 * Search bar responsiveness needs to be tweaked
 * Render default movie using `OMDb API` instead of being hard-coded
 * Repeat searches are buggy without first navigating `home` to search
 * Icon sizes and general styling
